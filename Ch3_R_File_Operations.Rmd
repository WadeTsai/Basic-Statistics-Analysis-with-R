##R如何匯入資料檔##
1. 使用內建資料，下例使用Anderson's Iris data set (https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%AE%89%E5%BE%B7%E6%A3%AE%E9%B8%A2%E5%B0%BE%E8%8A%B1%E5%8D%89%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E9%9B%86)
```{r}
data("iris") #將iris資料集載入Global Environment成為一個DataFrame
iris #列出iris資料集的所有欄位和每一筆資料
```

2. 匯入CSV
```{r}
mydataset <- read.csv("c:/users/Wade/OneDrive/Statistics/RealEstate/A_lvr_land_A.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",") #匯入台北市房地產時價登錄的CSV檔，並置入名為mydataset的dataframe中
```

3. 匯入SPSS (.sav)(read.spss函式不支援中文，如果遇到.sav檔中有中文則必須要從SPSS中匯出成CSV後再從R把CSV匯入)
```{r}
#install.packages("foreign") #如果之前沒有安裝過，要先安裝foreign套件
require(foreign) #載入foreign套件
mydataset <- read.spss("c:/users/Wade/OneDrive/Statistics/基礎統計分析/SPSS_SAV/3.2.sav") #使用foreign套件中的read.spss函式讀取侯老師提供的3.2.sav資料檔
```

4. 匯入Excel (.xlsx)(read.xlsx的效能不好，建議從Excel先轉成CSV後再匯入R)
```{r}
#install.packages("xlsx") #如果之前沒有安裝過，要先安裝xlsx套件
require(xlsx) #載入xlsx套件
mydataset <- read.xlsx("c:/users/Wade/OneDrive/Statistics/MSFT.xlsx", sheetIndex = 1) #使用xlsx套件中的read.xlsx函式讀取Excel檔案中的第一個工作表
```

##使用R內建的資料集##
* 很多人學R都是看上了R有數量龐大的套件，而很多套件為了讓人容易學習和練習，都有內建資料集。
data()這個function就可以列出某個package中有那些內建dataset，如:
```{r}
data(package="ggplot2")
```
從上面可以看出ggplot2套件內建了以上8個datasets。

* 如果不加參數，直接下data()，則會列出以下這些R的datasets套件裡內建的資料集:
```{r}
data()
```

* 也可以查看所有可用套件中的資料集
```{r}
data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))
```
結果如下:

##R如何匯出資料檔##
1. 匯出CSV檔案
```{r}
x <- data.frame(日期 = Sys.Date(), 抽出順序 = 1:6 , 本期大樂透明牌 = sample(1:49, 6, FALSE)) #將三個變數「日期」、「抽出順序」、「本期大樂透明牌」放到名為X的Data Frame中
write.csv(x, "d:/lotto.csv", row.names = FALSE, col.names = TRUE)
```
<hr>
  
##R如何儲存/載入RData##
1. 將R物件儲存成.RData檔案:
```{r}
save(iris, file = "d:/iris.RData")
```

2. 載入.RData檔案:
```{r}
load("d:/iris.Rdata")
```
